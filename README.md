# Web Testing Project


Hi! I'm Azwan:smiley:. This project is about to show some samples of web automation test project using Katalon Studio for those who are new to automation testing. This sample project will help you ease while learning Katalon Studio online at your own pace.

## Start
The web app that I tested is called Orange HRM, which can be visited at https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/. This app is a mock website that was created for automation testers to practice their skills on. The website is meant to mimic a Human Resources Management (HRM) application.



![You can go through the website and familiarize yourself with the listed possible features and scenarios.](https://i.ibb.co/Rpq0gsD/Orange-HRM.png)



You can go through the website and familiarize yourself to find possible features and scenarios.

### Note

 - Since this project folder contain external **.xlsx and .jpg** files which their VALUE are binded with their location so I will suggest you to clone this repository to **C:/Automation/PROJECT-WEB** to avoid execution error. If you know what you are doing then it is fine to ignore this point.

## Features


There are 6 features from this website that I had tested on:


| **List of features** | **Testing approaches** |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Education            | Behaviour Data-Driven  |
| Employee List        | Web Record             |
| Job Categories       | Behaviour Data-Driven  |
| Language             | Behaviour Data-Driven  |
| Pay Grades           | Web Record             |
| User                 | Web Record             |

> All the test artifacts e.g. test cases, test suites, data files, etc., that I had created for this web testing project were stored under a folder called ‘PROJECT WEB’, within the other main folders e.g. Test Cases, Test Suites, Data Files, etc.

- You can try it first then compare it with mine if you have any problem with the execution. So hope you will enjoy your learning on test automation with Katalon Studio. :v:
